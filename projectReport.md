# Project Report

## Test Cases
The [Testing Folder](/testing) has code used to generate 5 randomized lists of varying sizes. I chose to use test cases of size 10, 20, 35, 50, and 100. I generated lists of random elements between a range of 1through 5. I printed the random lists to [testCases.md](/testing/testCases.md) and copied over the contents to [main.py](/algorithms/main.py) as necessary.

Additionally, I created two manual testcases to match the examples I used in the [finalProjectProposal.md](finalProjectProposal.md). These were used to prove that my algorithms functioned the same way my examples showed they would.

All testcase outputs can be found in the [algorithms README.md](/algorithms/README.md)



## Plot [Plot](/plot)
The excel sheet used to create the plot can be found in [Plot](/plot).

Below is an image of the data used to plot the size of the test cases on the x axis, and time on the y axis. The graph does not include the last two runtimes of the brute force algorithm. This is because those values are too large in relation to the rest of the runtimes. If I included them in the graph, the plot would be too zoomed out for us to be able to note the differences in the smaller testcases.
